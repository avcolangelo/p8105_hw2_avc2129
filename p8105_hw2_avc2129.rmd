## Problem 0

* create a public GitHub repo + local R Project; we suggest naming this repo / directory p8105_hw2_YOURUNI (e.g. p8105_hw2_ajg2202 for Jeff), but thatâ€™s not required
* create a single .Rmd file named p8105_hw2_YOURUNI.Rmd that renders to github_document
* create a subdirectory to store the local data files used in Problems 1 and 2, and use relative paths to access these data files submit a link to your repo via Courseworks
