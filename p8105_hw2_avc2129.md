## Problem 1: Mr. Trash Wheel

### Read and clean Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

  - Specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries
    (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using
    arguments in read\_excel.\`
  - Use reasonable variable names
  - Omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  - Round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and convert
    the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

<!-- end list -->

``` r
trash_data =
  read_excel("./data/mr_trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N408") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0)) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls))
```

### Read and clean precipitation data for 2017 and 2018.

  - For each, omit rows without precipitation data and add a variable
    year.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
precip_17 = 
  read_excel("./data/mr_trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = 6, range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = 2017)
```

``` r
precip_18 = 
  read_excel("./data/mr_trash_wheel.xlsx", sheet = 5, range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = 2018)
```

  - Combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character
    variable (the variable month.name is built into R and should be
    useful).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
precip_data =
  full_join(precip_17, precip_18, by = c("month", "year", "total")) %>%
  arrange(month) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

### Write a paragraph about these data; you are encouraged to use inline R.

  - Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting
    datasets, and give examples of key variables.
  - For available data, what was the total precipitation in 2018?
  - What was the median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017?

In the Mr. Trash Wheel data set, there are 344 observations and 14
columns or variables for each observation. An example of a key variable
includes the weight of trash removed, which totals 1122.45 tons from May
2014 to June 2019. Another key variable is homes powered, which the
average dumpster powered 43.8250969 homes in the same time frame. The
median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

In the precipitation data set, there are 24 observations and 3 columns
or variables for each observation. An example of a key variable is total
precipitation, which averaged 2.7441667 in 2017. An example of another
key variable is month, the average precipitation in July for both 2017
and 2018 was 8.645. The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33.

## Problem 2: ….

This problem uses the FiveThirtyEight data; these data were gathered to
create the interactive graphic on this page. In particular, we’ll use
the data in pols-month.csv, unemployment.csv, and snp.csv. Our goal is
to merge these into a single data frame using year and month as keys
across datasets.

First, clean the data in pols-month.csv. Use separate() to break up the
variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day; replace month
number with month name; create a president variable taking values gop
and dem, and remove prez\_dem and prez\_gop; and remove the day
variable.
